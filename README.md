# my_project

The application is used to control the tests of concrete samples. It allows you to create a user who can be associated with the researcher and grant him access rights to specific functionalities. You can add further tests of prepared samples and entered using the admin panel. At the moment, you cannot add samples yourself, but only add tests of available samples yourself (to be developed in the future).
